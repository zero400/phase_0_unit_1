## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

To create a repository on the GitHub site, there is a NEW button at the upper right corner next to the username and account settings. If you wish to clone the repository, you can use the GitHub App or the command line. With the app, clone button is right on the repository, hard to miss and it clones it to the GitHub folder in Documents. If you forget where the path is, just hover over the repository. 

Open Source promotes universal access based on the free license to prevent people from claiming licensing for the code once it is out in the world. Free software is that which has; 
Freedom 0: The freedom to run the program for any purpose.
Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.
Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
Freedom 3: The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits.

I think open source can be a great thing. It might make our work as programmers easier or less expensive. If it works, it is an ideal utopia. CopyLeft tries to ensure that all those prosocial coders get reimbursed with a world of free code that they in no way could have accomplished themselves. 

If you don't use a license, you cannot control how your code is redistributed. You cannot have claim to the code you wrote. While that might be fine, no one wants someone else to make money off of their hard work without any reckognition. Licenses have a wide range for most needs and restrictions. Some people think free is freedom of use(for the vendor) and some things its freedom of access and that the code shouldn't be charged for. 

I struggled with the difference of CopyLeft and Permissive Free Licensing. Figuring out the difference felt pretty good. I got lost in the rabit hole of reading around about Licensing for a while. Very interesting but my time management wasn't great this week. 

I accidentally deleted my first reflections on this and don't remember what I used. Mostly Wikipedia and the linked resources.
