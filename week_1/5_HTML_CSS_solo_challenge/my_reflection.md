Why did I wait so long? Why is this footer wrapping at the top left. What do I want the page to look like? Am I experimenting or going for functionality or style? How can I pace myself? What are good breaks and how long a day should I work on this?

Positioning in CSS is the hardest thing. The box model can be hard to visualize when an element is only being filled up with a couple characters. I figured that reading code was really helpful. 

A few, I have looked at a few people's html that they posted and a few of their design styles are really cool. I have tried messing around with the attributes that they are looking at. 

I am confident with HTML to a point and not confident with CSS. I didn't time manage well this week so Next week(this week.) My goal is to get on schedule and the next week I will be ahead. 

Getting things right in CSS while frustrating was the best feeling because they were also the hardest and most tedious.
