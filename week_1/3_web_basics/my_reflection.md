I learned the difference between a website and a webApp. A webApp requires dynamic user interaction. The world wide web is the network of hyperlinks between sites that google measures to give search results and creates the structure of the web that the servers that comprise the internet host. 

What I want to remind myself about setting up an HTML site;
+Always have <html> & <body>
+Properly Space your code so that it is easier to read. 
+Hosting a site on a server and keeping a version control system to keep track of it. 
+Frustrated at first because I didn't allow time for the DNS servers to update. The relieved and excited to move on. 
+I have a better understanding of working with  GitHub than I did 12 hours ago. 
+I enrolled in Coursera's web applications design course during the prep period which had a secion on internet vs web and some history. Not coming into this reading blind made this section a bit easier.
