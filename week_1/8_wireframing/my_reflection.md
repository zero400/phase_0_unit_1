Design should be based on the user's experience. It is also much easier to develop when you have a blueprint. If you can simplify everything on paper, you don't have to redo all of the workarounds trying to scaffold a design that keeps moving around. You know your enemy. Also, KISS design. I was always the kid that didn't show his work in math, so wireframing isn't my bliss. It helps to jott and draw when solving a problem though. 

Just the suggested reading. I have done wireframing before so I didn't go too indepth on this. 

I found some new tools to wire frame. I prefer to do it by hand but I found a site I like for when I have to share my design. 

When you are feeling stressed, most things are tedious but completion is always enjoyable.
