## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

THIS is not the first time I have written this reflection. I deleted my phase_0_unit_1 repository that I forked because I got stressed about submissions and thought everything had to be in our unit_1_projects repository. I had troubles deleting a repository. I skyped a bit with another boot who showed my that it was located in the settings of each repository. At the very bottom, there is a dangerous looking red button. I know version control is all about being there for you in the ups and the downs but sometimes I just need to find a new repository with a more accurate name and glowing personality. I still am confused about the best way to work between directories and need experience with pushes and pulls and forks and merges before I feel comfortable. I will pair next week and try to learn that from someone. 

Git is whats called a version control system. It keeps track of all of your drafts of essays or code or pictures or whatever. You can save when and what changes were made over time with the capacity to look at snapshots from a certain time. Github essentially took all of that and added facebook to it. You can share, collaborate, store online, and message about anything that you can work on with GIT. It also has a nifty Graphical User Interface.

Version control tracks the changes to files you tell it to over time. It saves which changes were made and when so if you liked something better in a previous patch you can go back to it. Github helps this by extending the code to yourself on different computers or to others that you want to code with. Coding is a team sport and the internet is the playing field thanks in part to Github's ability to share code with those you want and merge changes and differnet pieces. 

Developers use version control to collaborate and as safegaurds against making mistakes. Yes, this makes sense. I am sure there is a problem I haven't thought of but nothing that doesn't make sense.

I don't understand how it tracks the changes. I read that it stored differences in a HASH but I can't think of what that looks like. I knew it shouldn't store multiple versions of the file, the memory wouldn't allow it.
