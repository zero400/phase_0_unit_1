HTML is a markup language with the box-model of positioning. Everything has opacity and a position with borders and padding and margins. What I don't understand is what a vendor Prefix is for or when I need to use it. Is it best practice but unnecessary? I don't understand how boxing-size is different than the box model. Does it just limit height and width to scale values inside of the constraints of say 400px instead of adding the width of magin to the 400px? Semantics are interesting but I don't yet know all of the differences or functionality of semantics other than for SEO. What could I build that takes advantage of these?

What I like is that with styling and markup, putting something on the web is not complicated. People make it complicated getting fancy which is both inspiring and daunting but I want to be one of those people so I will read more. 

Not that I can remember. Maybe with small things but the concepts are older to me so I just had a reintroduction months after my one night stand with this resourceful and complex mistress.

I didn't end up using it yet but a quick google gave me

so that I could easily find RBG values.
