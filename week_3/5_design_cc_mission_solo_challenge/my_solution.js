// This is a solo challenge

// Create a character, an enemy class, and a weapon class
// a character can have a weapon.
// The character and enemies should initially each have a health and attack.

// Pseudocode

I fell behind with this so I just want to do some Pseudocode. 
Create a hero and enemy class
both can inherit from a class that gives  things legs. 
	Legs: health, attack, move(), die(), fight(),

I need to differentiate hero and enemy classes by giving the hero player options. 
I will overwrite the movve function to take inputs from the user but then work
the same based on the canvas map. 

The part that I think would raise the most creativity is the weapon class. I 
would want to have a weapon on the map that is like an objective. If you can find
the weapon, it should increase you attack, the range at which you can fight(). 
I could call it a blacksmith if I wanted to increase its the hero's health. 
Should enemys be able to pick up te weapon. Certainly for simplicity, no. But for
a better game, yes. Assuming I had the time and did this (I want to! especially with)
friends and help at DBC) Should the AI point the enemies there? if so, for what intensity
is difficulty a factor and should you have options to take it back.
