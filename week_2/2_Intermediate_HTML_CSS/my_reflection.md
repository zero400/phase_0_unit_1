# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Web Standards are very helpful for reading code and extremely helpful for beginners. Novices gain a lot of productivity from strict rules and I am in need of learning web standards as well as when it is appropriate to break them. 

By standard structure, I assume that the question means header and body and semantic breakdowns of headers and groupings. These all make sense but take time to master. 

I am glad I do not have to relearn habits. I can use them when I want and feel that they can only help. 

I am not entirely sure why the reset is necessary. I know it can help with compatibility of older browswers. I think it might allow for more customization?

I used to use Internet Explorer and Mozilla and use Safari when I must but I prefer Chrome. Good or bad requires more context than different. If the sites are different, is there a reason for them to be? If it is easier to program than I don't see a problem with it as long as the services are equivalent.
