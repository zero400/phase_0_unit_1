* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?


I have work and it is a lot about daily habits. How do I set a sustainable pace for maximum productivity and happiness? What is that happiness? I am under the impression that I don't fully understand but if I do a bit more every day to create and sustain good habits, I think I will be ok. Pomodoro doesn't seem to be working for me but I will continue to try. My biggest challenge is staying on task when I am tired from work and the gym and staying focused. 

Will power to stay on task and shut out some things that make me happy but don't make me great. 

Consistently sleeping early and waking as early with something physical to set a pace for the day. I find that if I get up and painfully get active, I will have more energy throughout the day. 

I am still working on the plan. The plan is to keep working, Stay happy, Stay motivated, Create tiny Habits, Get Ripped, and Get caught up and put up examples that further my hobbies and profesisonal goals.
