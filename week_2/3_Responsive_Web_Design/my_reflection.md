# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


Responsive web design is the creation of websites in terms of fractions of a page instead of static widths. It allows the window to resize during different iterations of how the website is accessed and viewed. I like it. It looks good. I think there will be a time when I want to have a statically sized site and I am curious when that will be. 

Smartphones require simple UI to achieve great effect. The screens will be small and you want your content to section or size accordingly. It is up to the designer to choose when is appropriate. Tablets have changed web design. 

Visually impaired people can and should be able to access the web but there are many barriers. Semantically programming and having an audio version of the text would be appropriate for increasing ease of access. 

I didn't learn it here but KISS. Keep it simple stupid should be the design theory of everything I make. This is being reinforced by "Pragmatic Thinking and Learning" and the learning of interdependence of tools.
